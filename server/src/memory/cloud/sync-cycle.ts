/**
 * One full conversation with the dashboard: ask, send the difference, collect what came back.
 *
 * ── WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `.reticle/` is the source of truth and always will be. Reticle has to work with no account and no
 * network; a verification that blocks on an HTTP round trip is one somebody switches off. So the
 * dashboard is a REPLICA, and this is the replication protocol:
 *
 *   1. ASK      GET /v1/sync/status  → run ids it already holds, a content hash per derived record
 *   2. SEND     POST /v1/sync        → only unseen runs, only records whose hash moved
 *   3. COLLECT  GET /v1/sync/pull    → decisions a human made there, since our cursor
 *   4. APPLY    write them to .reticle/issues.json so the HUD and the next run can see them
 *
 * ASK-THEN-SEND, not send-everything. A three-hour session rewrites impact.json on every tool call;
 * uploading it each time would re-send the same megabytes dozens of times, and a sync that costs
 * that much is one people turn off — which is the real failure, because a dashboard nobody syncs to
 * is a dashboard nobody opens. When nothing has moved, a cycle sends nothing at all, and that is
 * what makes running it on a timer affordable.
 *
 * HASHES, NOT TIMESTAMPS. Two machines comparing their own clocks is a guess: they drift, and a
 * laptop that was asleep will cheerfully decide it is current. A content hash is an answer.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS, ALWAYS. The pull runs even when there is nothing to push — a quiet machine is
 * precisely the one whose dashboard somebody has been triaging on, so skipping the pull when the
 * push is empty would starve the direction that matters most.
 *
 * NOTHING IS DELETED LOCALLY ON SUCCESS. A lost response costs one redundant upload rather than a
 * hole in the record, and the server dedupes by run id anyway.
 *
 * Every dependency is injected — the clock, the fetch, the reads and writes — because this is the
 * one piece of Reticle that talks to a network AND to a disk, and it must be provable without either.
